##  1. <a name='TheTABotProject'></a>The TA Bot Project

The **TA Bot project** is a research project aimed to promote self-regulated learning using a combination of intelligent conversational agents (Chatbots), learning analytics, and gamification technologies. The goal is to help students better regulate their learning activities and achieve learning goals in a supportive, informative, and fun environment, while freeing the instructors from some mundane activities (e.g. sending reminders and answering FAQs).

The TA Bot is currently available as a Slack app and works with the Canvas learning management system. It is available for selected courses with instructors' consent. The app is still in the prototype stage and improvements are expected over time. Students' participation in the project is voluntary. 




##  2. <a name='HowCanIParticipateintheTABotproject'></a>How can I participate in the TA Bot project?

Here are a few simple steps you can follow to participate in the TA Bot project.

1. **Install the Slack App** on your desktop and/or on your phone. 
2. Accept the invitation to **join your course's slack workspace**.
3. Locate the "TA Bot" app already installed in the slack workspace and **say "Hi" to complete an onboarding process**.
4. **Complete a background survey**
5. **Interact with the "TA Bot"** app through Slack throughout the semester. You may respond to push notifications from the "TA Bot" or talk to the "TA Bot" (e.g. asking a question and inquiry your leaderboard status).
6. **Complete an end-of-course survey** at the end of this course.

##  3. <a name='WhatdoIGetfromParticipatingintheTABotProject'></a>What do I get from participating in the TA Bot project?

You will have a first-hand experience with the Chatbot technology, and the Chatbot is designed to assist you with your learning throughout your course (e.g. you may be reminded of a pending submission deadline and get an instant answer to a question).  

In addition, to encourage participation, there is an **Amazon gift card drawing** among participating students. 
- The first drawing will happen on September 20 (about two weeks into the semester). All students who have activated the TA bot finished the onboarding for the TA bot, and completed the background survey are eligible. Winners will receive a $20 Amazon gift card and the winning chance is approximately one in five. 
- There may be another similar drawing at the end of your course among students who additionally complete the end-of-course survey. 

##  4. <a name='IstheprojectapprovedbyIRBDoIneedtosignaconsentform'></a>Is the project approved by IRB? Do I need to sign a consent form?

Yes. The project is approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Because the project imposes no or minimum risk and is used for educational purposes, it is exempt from requiring a consent form from participants. Instead, a [Research Information Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heUQWt4ds1v6QcQFHiBX3_BiOuNekf0y/view?usp=sharing) is provided to each voluntary participant. Please read this sheet to learn more about the project and your right.      


##  5. <a name='HowDoIInstallandSetupSlack'></a>How do I install and set up Slack?

Slack works on multiple platforms, and you can use it both on your personal computer and your mobile phone/tablet. Below are the links to download Slack for different platforms.

- Download for Windows and Mac: https://slack.com/downloads
- Install the Slack App on your mobile phone, including [iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios) and [Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android) devices. 

After receiving the invitation from your instructors to join the course slack workspace, you may accept it and proceed to set up Slack, be sure to **use your @umn email**. The TA Bot may not work with non-umn email addresses.

Tips:

- It is a good idea to install Slack both on your computer and mobile phone. The desktop app is more efficient and the mobile app keeps you updated.
- If you have a problem joining the workspace, please [find more information here](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace).
- If you have trouble signing into a workspace, please [find more information here](https://slack.com/help/articles/212681477-Sign-in-to-Slack). 


##  6. <a name='HowdoIUseSlack'></a>How do I use Slack?

Slack has different channels in a Workspace, and you can see a list of them on the left sidebar. In addition to channels, the compose button, notifications, and direct messages are also located in the sidebar. Here is a very nice and short video on a quick start guide to Slack:

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2JuAa6-ors" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Also, [this link](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users) provides information on how to set up your profile, and configure your notifications. When you start using Slack, we suggest you update your profile, since it lets other people in the Workspace know you better.

You can find extra information about how to use Slack in their website's [Tutorial section](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049063).

##  10. <a name='LeaderBoard'></a>Leader board and points

To increase fun, the TA Bot maintains a leaderboard among students of the course. The leaderboard ranks learners on a weekly basis based on a point system, which incorporates learner's canvas page views, assignment submissions, and chatbot conversations. The point accumulation rules are as follows.

Please note that the leaderboard points are independent of your course grading system, and do affect your course grade in any way. 

| Category |  Condition for 1 point | Condition for 2 points | Condition for 3 point |
|--|--|--|--|
| Weekly Canvas page views | 1 to 9 page views | 10 to 99 page views | >100 page views
| Assignment submissions | Submitted on the due day | Submitted before the due date |
| Chatbot conversations | 1 to 4 conversations | 5 to 9 conversations | 10+ conversations

*Note: We record a chatbot conversation if you respond to a push notification or initiate a query. Consecutive interactions are considered one conversation.*

As you accumulate points, your avatar may level up. See the next section. 

##  11. <a name='AvatarLevels'></a>Avatars and levels

Meanwhile, the point is also related to the avatar level. The avatar will evolve to the second level if you reach 10 points, and will evolve to the third level if you reach 50.

An example of Avatar appearances is as follows.

##  12. <a name='HowdoIgethelporreportproblems'></a>How do I get help or report a problem?
